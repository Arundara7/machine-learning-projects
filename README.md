# machine-learning-projects
A machine learning project that builds a Naive Bayes classifier to detect spam emails using text preprocessing, vectorization, and probabilistic modeling.
This project focuses on developing a fully functional Naive Bayes–based spam classification system, designed to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages with high accuracy. It demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow — from data preprocessing to feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to showcase how classical machine learning algorithms can be effectively applied to real-world NLP problems such as email filtering and message classification. By cleaning and transforming raw text into meaningful representations, the model learns patterns commonly found in spam messages, including repeated keywords, promotional phrases, suspicious patterns, and unusual formatting. Using the probabilistic strengths of Naive Bayes, the classifier is able to make fast and reliable predictions, even on large volumes of messages. This project is ideal for anyone exploring NLP fundamentals, spam detection techniques, classical ML algorithms, and practical data science workflows. It highlights how simple yet powerful models like Naive Bayes continue to be widely used in industry for tasks such as email filtering, SMS classification, and automated content moderation.
